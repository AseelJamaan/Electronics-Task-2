### Overview
This project demonstrates controlling four DC motors using the L293D motor driver and an Arduino Uno. The circuit and code were built and tested using TinkerCAD.

### What is a DC Motor?
A DC motor is an electric motor that runs on direct current (DC).

### Features:
- Converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
- Speed and direction can be controlled.
- Commonly used in robotics, fans, and toys.
  
### What is L293D?
The L293D is a motor driver IC that allows control of DC motors.

### Why Use L293D?
- Arduino cannot directly power motors due to current limitations.
- The L293D amplifies the Arduinoâ€™s signals to control motor speed and direction.
- Supports up to two motors per IC.

### Why This Setup?
We used L293D to control the four DC motors in a sequence (forward, backward, and alternating directions), showcasing its ability to handle multiple motors with ease.
This project is a simple demonstration of motor control and is perfect for beginners exploring Arduino and motor drivers.
